Revision history for Ruby library Diff::LCS. Unless explicitly noted otherwise,
all changes are produced by Austin Ziegler <diff-lcs@halostatue.ca>.

== Diff::LCS 1.0.1
* Minor modifications to the gemspec, the README.
* Renamed the diff program to ldiff (as well as the companion batch file) so as
  to not collide with the standard diff program.
* Fixed issues with RubyGEMs. Requires RubyGems > 0.6.1 or >= 0.6.1 with the
  latest CVS version.

== Diff::LCS 1.0
* Initial release based mostly on Perl's Algorithm::Diff.
