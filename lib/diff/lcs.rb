module Diff
    # = Diff::LCS 1.0.2
    # Computes "intelligent" differences between two ordered Enumerables. This
    # is an implementation of the McIlroy-Hunt "diff" algorithm for Enumerable
    # objects that include Diffable.
    #
    # Based on Mario I. Wolczko's <mario@wolczko.com> Smalltalk version (1.2,
    # 1993) and Ned Konz's <perl@bike-nomad.com> Perl version
    # (Algorithm::Diff).

    # == Synopsis
    #   require 'diff/lcs'
    #
    #   seq1 = %w(a b c e h j l m n p)
    #   seq2 = %w(b c d e f j k l m r s t)
    #
    #   lcs = Diff::LCS.LCS(seq1, seq2)
    #   diffs = Diff::LCS.diff(seq1, seq2)
    #   sdiff = Diff::LCS.sdiff(seq1, seq2)
    #   seq = Diff::LCS.traverse_sequences(seq1, seq2, callback_obj)
    #   bal = Diff::LCS.traverse_balanced(seq1, seq2, callback_obj)
    #
    # Alternatively, objects can be extended with Diff::LCS:
    #
    #   seq1.extend(Diff::LCS)
    #   lcs = seq1.lcs(seq2)
    #   diffs = seq1.diff(seq2)
    #   sdiff = seq1.sdiff(seq2)
    #   seq = Diff::LCS.traverse_sequences(seq1, seq2, callback_obj)
    #   bal = Diff::LCS.traverse_balanced(seq1, seq2, callback_obj)
    # 
    # Default extensions are provided for Array and String objects through the
    # use of 'diff/lcs/array' and 'diff/lcs/string'.
    #
    # == Introduction (by Mark-Jason Dominus)
    # I once read an article written by the authors of +diff+; they said that
    # they hard worked very hard on the algorithm until they found the right
    # one.
    #
    # I think what they ended up using (and I hope someone will correct me,
    # because I am not very confident about this) was the `longest common
    # subsequence' method. In the LCS problem, you have two sequences of
    # items:
    #
    #    a b c d f g h j q z
    #    a b c d e f g i j k r x y z
    #
    # and you want to find the longest sequence of items that is present in
    # both original sequences in the same order. That is, you want to find a
    # new sequence *S* which can be obtained from the first sequence by
    # deleting some items, and from the secend sequence by deleting other
    # items. You also want *S* to be as long as possible. In this case *S*
    # is:
    # 
    #    a b c d f g j z
    #
    # From there it's only a small step to get diff-like output:
    #
    #    e   h i   k   q r x y
    #    +   - +   +   - + + +
    #
    # This module solves the LCS problem. It also includes a canned function
    # to generate +diff+-like output.
    #
    # It might seem from the example above that the LCS of two sequences is
    # always pretty obvious, but that's not always the case, especially when
    # the two sequences have many repeated elements. For example, consider
    #
    #    a x b y c z p d q
    #    a b c a x b y c z
    #
    # A naive approach might start by matching up the +a+ and +b+ that
    # appear at the beginning of each sequence, like this:
    # 
    #    a x b y c         z p d q
    #    a   b   c a b y c z
    #
    # This finds the common subsequence +a b c z+. But actually, the LCS is
    # +a x b y c z+:
    #
    #          a x b y c z p d q
    #    a b c a x b y c z
    #
    # === Key Generation
    # The Perl version accepts an optional hash-key generation code reference
    # because all comparisons are done stringwise. This is not necessary for
    # Ruby, as the spaceship operator (<=>) should be provided on classes that
    # may be present in an ordered Enumerable.

      # Diff::LCS.traverse_sequences is the most general facility provided by this

      #
      # Imagine that there are two arrows. Arrow A points to an element of
      # sequence A, and arrow B points to an element of the sequence B.
      # Initially, the arrows point to the first elements of the respective
      # sequences. +traverse_sequences+ will advance the arrows through the
      # sequences one element at a time, calling an appropriate
      # user-specified callback function before each advance. It will
      # advance the arrows in such a way that if there are equal elements
      # <tt>A[ii]</tt> and <tt>B[jj]</tt> which are equal and which are part
      # of the LCS, there will be some moment during the execution of
      # +traverse_sequences+ when arrow A is pointing to <tt>A[ii]</tt> and
      # arrow B is pointing to <tt>B[jj]</tt>. When this happens,
      # +traverse_sequences+ will call the <tt>:match</tt> lambda and then
      # it will advance both arrows.
      #
      # Otherwise, one of the arrows is pointing to an element of its
      # sequence that is not part of the LCS. +traverse_sequences+ will
      # advance that arrow and will call the <tt>:discard_a</tt> or the
      # <tt>:discard_b</tt> lambdas, depending on which arrow it advanced.
      # If both arrows point to elements that are not part of the LCS, then
      # +traverse_sequences+ will advance one of them and call the
      # appropriate callback, but it is not specified which it will call.
      #
      # The arguments to +traverse_sequences+ are the two sequences to
      # traverse, and a hash which specifies the lambdas, like this:
      #
      #   traverse_sequences(seq1, seq2,
      #                      :match => callback_1,

      #                      :discard_b => callback_3)
      #
      # The lambdas for <tt>:match</tt>, <tt>:discard_a</tt>, and
      # <tt>:discard_b</tt> are invoked with the indices of the two arrows
      # as their arguments and are not expected to return any values.
      #
      # If arrow A reaches the end of its sequence before arrow B does,
      # +traverse_sequences+ will call the <tt>:a_finished</tt> lambda with
      # the last index in A. If <tt>:a_finished</tt> does not exist, then
      # <tt>:discard_b</tt> will be called until the end of the B sequence.
      # If B terminates before A, then <tt>:b_finished</tt> or

      # +traverse_balanced+ is an alternative to +traverse_sequences+. It
      # uses a different algorithm to iterate through the entries in the
      # computed LCS. Instead of sticking to one side and showing element
      # changes as insertions and deletions only, it will jump back and
      # forth between the two sequences and report <em>changes</em>
      # occurring as deletions on one side followed immediatly by an
      # insertion on the other side.
      #
      # In addition to the <tt>:discard_a</tt>, <tt>:discard_b</tt>, and
      # <tt>:match</tt> callbacks supported by +traverse_sequences+,
      # +traverse_balanced+ supports a <tt>:change</tt> callback indicating
      # that one element got +replaced+ by another:
      #
      # traverse_sequences(seq1, seq2,
      #                    :match => $callback_1,
      #                    :discard_a => $callback_2,
      #                    :discard_b => $callback_3,
      #                    :change    => $callback_4,)
      #
      # If no <tt>:change</tt> callback is specified, +traverse_balanced+
      # will map <tt>:change</tt> events to <tt>:discard_a</tt> and
      # <tt>:discard_b</tt> actions, therefore resulting in a similar
      # behaviour as +traverse_sequences+ with different order of events.
      #
      # +traverse_balanced+ might be a bit slower than +traverse_sequences+,
      # noticable only while processing huge amounts of data.
      #
      # The +sdiff+ function of this module is implemented as call to
      # +traverse_balanced+.
